	About Me</h2><p>

I am a business intelligence engineer/ data analyst hybrid
coding primarily in python and c#. <br>

I enjoy the eureka moments occur
when finding unexpected patterns in data. I also get gratification from tangiblly
making people's jobs/lives easier or better through technology. My current interests include predictive modeling, simulations, and streamling statistical model deployments.<br><br>


My interests outside of programming include listening to the Beatles, playing
the guitar, and daydreaming. <br><br>

I have started this collection for sources control purpose as well as to 
track my development over time with the hidden agenda of showing off my expert use of html tags :)ent over time with the hidden agenda of showing off my expert use of html tags. :)
